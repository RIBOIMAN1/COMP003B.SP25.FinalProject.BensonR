# COMP003B.SP25.FinalProject.BensonR
* Using concepts I have learned, including middleware, scaffolding, and routing, this site aims to showcase the many things that I have learned throughout the ASP.NET course.
* Some of the key dependencies used in this project include ASP.NET Core MVC, Web API, Entity Framework Core, the use of the NuGet Package Manager, and SQL Server via dependency injection. To open the NuGet Package Manager, you can right-click the solution in the "Solution Explorer" tab and click "Manage NuGet Packages" for a GUI-based approach, or click "Tools" → "NuGet Package Manager" → "Package Manager Console" for a CLI-based solution. This is required to reference multiple things throughout the project.
* This is a mock computer repair shop application list called "RIBOI Techsperts," taking inspiration from "Salem Techsperts," a popular computer technician YouTuber who runs a computer repair shop. This will use features including middleware, CRUD operations for MVC controllers, and Entity Framework migration.
